Weapons start at test_battle/in/binaryfile/eitm_data.bin from at most offset 0x6C (Broadsword).
NOTE: Changing this file will not directly modify your game depending on your region setting.
A copy of all the data is located in text_battle/us/binaryfile/battle_pack.bin
Most people will want to modify this file instead. Re-locate the Broadsword sequence here.

Not sure about start and end-points per weapon but each is definitely 52 bytes in length:

Known Weapon Fields per Byte (Starting from offset 0x6C and repeating every 52 bytes):
Weapon Type? (0x0A for melee, 0x64 for ranged, 0x14 for Kumbha, 0xC8 for Seitengrat)
Damage Formula
ATK
??? (0x00 or 0x0A depending on weapon type, e.g. all Spears are 0A and all Ninja Swords are 00)
Combo Rate
Evasion
Elemental Effect
On-Hit Status Effect Inflict Chance
On-Hit "Bad" Status Effect Group 1
On-Hit "Bad" Status Effect Group 2
On-Hit "Good" Status Effect Group 1 (e.g. Faith=0x20)
On-Hit "Good" Status Effect Group 2 (e.g. Berserk=0x80, Regen=0x02)
4 Bytes -> Weapon Classifications/Icons? Haven't explored in-depth (For example, Spears are equal to eachother here, but 2H and 1H swords get differentiated)
Special Property Group(s) (I've looked at stat and elemental potency boosts so far)
^ Probably spans more than 1 byte
Not sure about the rest or where weapons are separated.

Status and elemental effects seem to share the same values/arithmetic system as in armor and accessories.
Multiple effects correspond to an addition of their respective values.

Damage Formula Values:
0x14 Strength(Sword, Spear, Rod)
0x15 Speed (Ninja Sword, Dagger)
0x16 Magick (Katana, Staff)
0x17 Vitality (Axe, Hammer, Hand-bomb)
0x18 Pole
0x19 Bow
0x1A Cross-bow
0x1B Pierce (Gun, Measures, Healing Rods)
0x68 Mace

Some observed Special Properties in the first byte (unverified but probably correct):
18: Potency: Water (Fumarole, Six-fluted Pole)
30: Potency: Fire (Burning Bow)
60: +2 MAG (most Rods, Oak Staff)
C0: +3 MAG and Wind Boost (Cherry Staff)
I don't know if these use the same kind of arithmetic as other item properties.
